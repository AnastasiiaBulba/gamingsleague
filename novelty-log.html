                      We've added exciting new candy types to make your tossing

                      Each candy type has unique properties that affect gameplay
                      - some are easier to match, while others provide bonus
                      points when you create perfect trios. The update also
                      includes improved visual effects and smoother animations

                      Major performance optimizations have been implemented to
                      ensure smooth gameplay on all devices. We've reduced
                      loading times by 40% and improved frame rates across all
                      platforms. The game now runs more efficiently on mobile
                      devices while maintaining the same high-quality graphics.
                      We've also fixed several minor bugs and improved the
                      overall stability of the game.
